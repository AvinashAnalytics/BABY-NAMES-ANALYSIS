### **✨ Project Overview:**

Welcome to my **"Analyzing Naming Trends Using Python"** project! 🎉 This project explores popular **baby names** data provided by the **Social Security Administration (SSA)** of the United States. The goal was to analyze how baby names have changed over the years by gender and popularity. 📈

With the power of Python, I extracted, manipulated, and visualized data to uncover interesting insights into naming trends. Through this project, I learned how to clean and process large datasets, visualize data in insightful ways, and identify the most popular names by year. 👶💡

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- Visualized the trends of **male** vs **female** baby names over the years 🧑‍🦰👩‍🦰
- Discovered the **most popular baby names** by birth counts 🔝
- Explored data using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **zipfile** 📚

This project not only helped me enhance my **data wrangling** and **visualization** skills but also sparked a deeper interest in **exploratory data analysis** (EDA). ✨

### **🛠️ Tools and Technologies:**

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **pandas** 📊
- **matplotlib** 📈
- **zipfile**, **BytesIO** 📦

### **📂 Dataset Details:**

The dataset used in this project is provided by the **Social Security Administration (SSA)** and contains the most popular baby names in the U.S. from 1880 to the present. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **`Name`**: The name of the baby
- **`Sex`**: Gender of the baby (Male or Female)
- **`Count`**: Number of babies with that name in a given year
- **`Year`**: The year in which the baby was born

You can access the dataset directly from the [SSA Baby Names Data](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) and download it as a zipped folder. 🔽

### **🔍 Tasks & Insights:**

1. **Data Extraction & Preparation**:  
   Extracted the dataset from the zipped files and cleaned it for further analysis. Used Python libraries like **zipfile** and **BytesIO** to efficiently extract and load the data.

2. **Visualization of Trends**:  
   - Visualized the **number of male vs female babies born** across different years using **line plots**.
   - Analyzed trends of popular baby names over the years and identified the **top 100 baby names** based on birth counts.

3. **Key Findings**:  
   - Certain names like "James", "Mary", and "John" have remained consistently popular for decades.
   - The popularity of certain names fluctuates significantly, showing trends based on cultural shifts over time.
