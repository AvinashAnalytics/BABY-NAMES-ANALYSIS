# Baby Names Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project to explore trends in **baby names** in the United States. Using historical data from the **Social Security Administration (SSA)**, this project aims to analyze the popularity of baby names, visualize gender distribution, and identify top baby names over the years.

## Problem Statement
As a data analyst, the goal of this project was to explore and analyze the patterns in baby names over time. We specifically focus on:
- The number of male vs female babies born each year.
- Trends in the most popular baby names over the years.
- Identifying the top 100 most popular baby names based on birth counts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the **Social Security Administration (SSA)**, which includes:
- **Name**: The name of the baby.
- **Sex**: The gender of the baby (M for male, F for female).
- **Year**: The year the baby was born.
- **Count**: The number of times this name appeared in the given year.
